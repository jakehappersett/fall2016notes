Database Design Process

- store manage use data
- data is raw 
	information is analyzed data 
	knowledge is a combination of information context and experience
- dangers of decentrallized data management
	redundancy
	inconsistecny
	incompatibility
		different formats differnet constraints different models of the data
	inaccuracy
	lack of security
	lack o faccountability
	flexibility
- data should be:
	integrated
	shared
		different users and different levels of access to data 
- DBMS (database management system) a software system must provide facilities for:
	defining and constructing the database
	efficeint access to the common 
	manipulation
	supporting multiple views 
	maximizing the reliability and availability of the data
	definition and enforcemtn of contraints in single and multi user environments
	preventing unauthorized access to the data 
	reduce the need for application software maintenance by supporting a high level of independence 
	provide high level tools to simplify the development of application software

- Schema design 
	Describes the structure of the databse ( the objects that are represented in the database and the relationships among them) and teh type of content that each data element within the structure can contain 
	also called the Intension of the database
- Instance 
	the collection of data stored int he database at a particular time
	also called the extension of the database
- Logical Data Independence
	applications are insulated from changes in logical structure of the data
- physical data independence
	applications are insulated from changes in pphysical structure of the data 
- Concurrency control
	in a multiuser environment concurrent execution of the user programs is essential for good DBMS performance
	interleaving actions of different user programs can lead to inconsistency ( eg check is cleared while account balance is being computed ) 
	DBMS ensures such problems dont arise: users can pretend they are using a single user system
