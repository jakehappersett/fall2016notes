**tables**

-relational model (real databases)
	named collection of attributes
	two dimensional table WITHOUT duplicate rows 
	show primary and foreign keys
	when converting ER diagrams to relational models delete relations, each entity is a table

	row represents the actual occurence of a particular entity or relationship instance 
		> also called tuple 
		> order is not important

	column for each attribute 
		> requires primary key
		> order is not important

- candidate key
	a set of attributes of a relation for which the following three properties hold
		> uniqueness : the set of attributes take on a unique value for each tuple in teh rlation
		> non redundancy : if an attribute is removed from the set of attributes the remaining attributes doe not possess the uniqueness property
		> validity : no attribute value in the key may be null
	superkey : least redudant candidate key
	

- null value
	no data entered
	0 
	
- prime attribute
	an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key
- nonprime attribute
	an attribute that is not part of any candidate key

- integrity constraints
	
	entity integrity : no attribute that is part of a primary key (PK) can have a null value

	referential integrity : every foreign key value MUST match a primary key vlaue in an associated relation or be null

- representations : 

	one to many : place the primary key attribute of the entity type on the "one" side of the relationship as a foreign key in the "many" side of the relationship 

	many to many : create a "linking table"
		1 create a table for each entity
		2 create a linking table
			> include a primary key from each of the "many" sides as a foreign key
			> the combination of the two foreign key's is the linking table's primary key

	weak entity : primary key of main entity becomes primary key for weak entity
