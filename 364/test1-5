- specialization hierarchy with [d]isjoint subtypes 
	for each subtype the correspondign relationship includes 
		> the PK of its supertype
		> the attributes of the subtype
	the relation for the supertype includes 
		> the attributes of the supertype 
		> a subtype discriminator column that indicates which subtype applies to given row fo the supertpes relation

- specialization hierarchy with [o]verlapping subtypes 
	for subtype
		> same as disjoint
	for supertype
		> same as disjoint
		> discriminator column can be binar
