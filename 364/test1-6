***relational algerbra operators***

- SELECT
	output the rows of relation X that satisfy the specified condition
		--> output rows
		--> can select "all" "only" 

- PROJECT 
	output the values of the attributelist for all rows of relation X
		--> output columns
		--> removes duplicate rows

- JOIN 
	join rows from one relation to another 
		--> inner join
		--> outer join 

- UNION
	combindes all rows from two tables excluding duplicate rows
		--> both tables have to be the same with different values

- INTERSETCT
	tables must be "UNION" compatible
	outpust only those rows that exist in both tables

- DIFFERENCE 
	outputs only rows if the first table that do not exist in the second table 

- PRODUCT
	combines each row in the first table with every row in the second table
	

** JOIN SHIT** tables do not have to be union compatible


- INNER JOIN 
	--> natural join 	
		selects only rows with common values in the join attributes
		eliminates duplicate columns
		eliminates duplicate rows
		does not include unmatched pairs
	--> EQUI - JOIN 
		joins two relations by selecting only rows with common values for the join attributes
		eliminates duplicate rows
		does not include unmatched pairs
	--> Theta JOIN
		uses a comparison operator > < <= etc..

- OUTER JOIN
	--> RIGHT OUTER JOIN
		similar to inner join but includes the rows with null values on left 
	--> LEFT OUTER JOIN
		same as right, but null values are on the right
