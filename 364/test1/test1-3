**Generalization** 

- supertype 
	class that subtypes inherit from 
	all subtypes inherit relationships and attributes from supertypes

- specialization is the opposite of generalization

- symbols under the superclass denote how classes can inherit from superclass
	o : superclass can have more than one subtypes 
	d : superclass can have only one subtype

- completeness:	
	double line : total : mandatory - superclass has to inherit a subclass 
	single line : partial : optional - opposite 

- category
	similar to specialization and generalization but uses a "u" symbol instead of "d" or "o"
	
- ERM issues 
	ER diagrams help you understand design
	databases are always written with tables however
