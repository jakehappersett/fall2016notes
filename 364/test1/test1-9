- lossless decomposition
	join of subtables is the exact same as the original table
- lossy 
	if you join subtables the original table will be a subset of the joined table 
--> to determine: 
	1 look at common attribute between two 
	2 if the common attribute is NOT a primary key for either table
		>> lossy 
	3 if common attribute is a primary key for either of teh two tables
		>> lossless

**it is not sufficient that a decomposition be lossless**
** this is where normalization comes into play ** 

- Determination
	if a -> b (a determines b)
		for a given value of attribute a there is a unique value of attribute b 
	full functional dependancy : if attribute b is functiaonally dependent on determinant A but not on any subset of that determinant 
	
	rules for functional dependancy:

		1 if a -> b and b -> c 
			then a -> c 
		2 if a,b,c, and a -> c then a,b -> c 
		3 for {a,b,c,d,e},{a->b;b->d,a,b->e} then {a,b -> c,d,e}


**normalization** process of decomposing complex unstable data into simple stable form :: series of steps
- each step of normalization requires it be in the last steps form (4NF is also 3,2,&1NF)

steps

- first normal form 
	a relation is in 1NF if all associated domains are simple 
		--> thus if a relation has any multi-valued attribute it is not in 1NF
- second normal form 
	a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and each non-prime attribute is fully functionally dependent on the relation key 
- third normal form
	a relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there is no transitive dependancy (dependancy bewteen two non primary keys)
