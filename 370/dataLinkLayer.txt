** data link layer ** 
(for now talking specifically focused on ethernet)

- functions of the data link layer
	encapsulate packets into frames and MAC addressing(switches) [MAC host addressing (switching)]
	detec and discard errors that may occur in the physical layer [error detection]

- hop : identifies the number of switches or routers encoutntered, each switch or router constittes a hop!
	in packet switching a packet contains a hop count which increments with each hop. 
		> a packet iwth too large a hop count is discarded 

- switch vs. hub
	hub : a device capable of only broadcasting

	switch: device capable of unicasting, multi-casting, and broadcasting	
		> stops broadcasting when it is picked up and starts unicasting
		> almost used exclusively now instead of hubs
- PDU : protocol data unit

	layer 1: PDU is the bit
	layer 2: PDU is the frame
	layer 3: PDU is the packet
	layer 4: PDU is the segment
	layer 5 and above: PDU is DATA

- Ethernet
	low cost, high speed 
 	****can be 100 meters in radius and support about 250 devices***** (per segment) 

- LAN Ethernet protocol architecture
	consists of two sublayers
		1 medium access control MAC - physical
		2 logical link control LLC - logical

- logical link control
	allows support of multiplexing via service access points
	allows flow control through automatic repeat request (ARQ)

- connection vs connectionless service
	connectionless : like sending mail through the postal system.  
		> data is sent and we hope it arrives at its destination 
		> no feedack from the destination to indicate wheter it arrived or not
		> (tech equivalent is email)
	connection: like a phone conversation
		> connection is established by dialing an number
		> someone picking up the line establishes connection
		> connection is confirmed between the two parties
		> acknolwledgment is called an ACK
		> repeat is called a ARR (automatic repeat request)
- LLC sublayer
	max size is 1500 octets/bytes
	controls how things are logically put together
		> tells the NIC card where to buffer information it gets
