**network layer** : route packet to proper subnet (routing)

- vlan
	virtual local area network
	allows users in physically differnt locations ot communicate as if they were on a single LAN
	can logically rearrange nodes without moving cables 
	computers on one vlan cannot see computers on another even if they are physically connected

- difference between MAC address and IP address
	MAC address is within a network
		--> MAC header changes at each router 
	IP address remains the same at each router 	
	
	eachj port on the router has its own MAC address 

- protocol overview
	most common protocol is IP 
		--> 75%
	ipsec : internet protocol security
		--> protocol suite for securing IP protocol communicatiosn by authenticating and encrypting communication sessions
		--> functionality included in IPV6
	IGMP : internet group managmenet protocol
		--> used for multicasting
	ICMP : internet control message protocol 
		is used to suppoer netowrk management commands such as the ping command 

- IP address
	32 bits grouped in octets (binary)
		--> converted into decimal numbers 
		
	unlike MAC address IP addresses are assigned by network administrators (usually using DHCP)
		--> static IP doesn't change (printer, website, server) 
		--> Dynamic host configuration
			pool of IP addresses that can assign
			"IP leased for a specific ammount of time" 

- DHCP 
	dynamic host ocnfiguratipon protocol
	application layer protocol for automatic assingment of IP addresses in an organizations network

- dotted decimal notaion
	32 bit addresses broken into 4 blocks of 8 bits each 
	each block converted to decimal representation

- IP address structure
	broken into two parts 
		--> (sub)network portion
			also called the organizational part
			ususally associated with the ISP (or large organization like university [vcu's is 172.23]
		--> host portion 
			identifies the host within the network
			usually broken further into subnets
				> subnet ID
				> Host ID 
	subnet mastk tells where the IP is broken into these parts
	subnet mask HAS to go with IP address

- IP address classification
	classful
		--> dont use anymore
		--> fixed length subnet mask
		--> network parts were identified into 5 address classes
			in practice allowed three possible network sites 
				> Class A takes first octet for network, last 3 for hosts
				> class B takes first two octets for network , last 2 for hosts 
				> etc etc etc 
			255 numbers possible in one class

	**class A networks: **
		**first octet is in the range 0 - 127
		7 bits in network id
		address starts with 0 (ranging from 00000000 - 01111111) so 128 possible class A netowrks
			--> actually only 126 because 127 and 10 are both reserved
				> 127(.0.0.1) for loopback (check to see if stack is working)
				> 10 for private IP addresses 
		so first bit can be looked at to see if it is a classful network  
		next 24 bits are host addresses so each network has 2^24 = 16,777,216 IP 
		default subnet mask : 255.0.0.0
			--> 255 means "turn on" all 8 bits in the first octet and none in the other octets 
				> remember that shit above about 255 nubmers in one class 

	**class B networks: ** 
		first two bits are "10"
			--> (second bit is 0)
		**first octet ranges are from 128 - 191 (ranges from 1000000 - 10111111)
		default subnet mask : 255.255.0.0
		14 bits for network id (not 16)
		16 bits for host address in each network 
		private class B addresses are 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 and a subnet mask 255.240.0.0
 
	**class c networks: **
		first three bits are "110" 
		**first octet ranges are 192-223 or 11000000-11011111
		default subnet mask : 255.255.255.0
		21 bits for network ID 
		8 bits for host address in each network
		pricate class c addresses are 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 and subnet 255.255.0.0

	classless : classless Inter-domain routing
		--> fixed length subnet mask
	VLSM : variable length subnet mask
		
- classless inter domain routing
	eliminated the classful address classification
	class is no longer uniquely identifiable from the first few bits
	now it is:
		xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/n 
			--> n number of bits that are used for network part of address 
	allows us to vary the length of the IP address regardless of what the default class of the IP might have been

		 (ex) 
		128.172.0.0/16
		
		128.172 (are 16 bits all part of network portion)
			(could also say 255.255.0.0)


- subnet shit
	number of subnets = 2^n - 2 
		--> n = # of bits 
		--> -2 because you can't use all '0' or all '1'

	number of hosts = 2^h - 2 
		--> h = # bits for hosts 
		--> -2 because all '0' or all '1' 
	
	128.172.10.0/24 -> gets to vcu

	128.172.10._ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _  -> gets to vcu floor

		--> for n [left side](use formula with subnets = 4)
		--> for h [right side](use formula with  hosts = 5) 
		--> first 3 identify floor
		--> 255.255.255.(128)+(64)+(32) | (16)(8)(4)(2)(1)
			>> 224 
			>> 255.255.255.224 (subnet mask)
