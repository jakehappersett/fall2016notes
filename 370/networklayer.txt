**network layer** : route packet to proper subnet (routing)

- vlan
	virtual local area network
	allows users in physically differnt locations ot communicate as if they were on a single LAN
	can logically rearrange nodes without moving cables 
	computers on one vlan cannot see computers on another even if they are physically connected

- difference between MAC address and IP address
	MAC address is within a network
		--> MAC header changes at each router 
	IP address remains the same at each router 	
	
	eachj port on the router has its own MAC address 

- protocol overview
	most common protocol is IP 
		--> 75%
	ipsec : internet protocol security
		--> protocol suite for securing IP protocol communicatiosn by authenticating and encrypting communication sessions
		--> functionality included in IPV6
	IGMP : internet group managmenet protocol
		--> used for multicasting
	ICMP : internet control message protocol 
		is used to suppoer netowrk management commands such as the ping command 

- IP address
	32 bits grouped in octets (binary)
		--> converted into decimal numbers 
		
	unlike MAC address IP addresses are assigned by network administrators (usually using DHCP)
		--> static IP doesn't change (printer, website, server) 
		--> Dynamic host configuration
			pool of IP addresses that can assign
			"IP leased for a specific ammount of time" 

- DHCP 
	dynamic host ocnfiguratipon protocol
	application layer protocol for automatic assingment of IP addresses in an organizations network

- dotted decimal notaion
	32 bit addresses broken into 4 blocks of 8 bits each 
	each block converted to decimal representation

- IP address structure
	broken into two parts 
		--> (sub)network portion
			also called the organizational part
			ususally associated with the ISP (or large organization like university [vcu's is 172.23]
		--> host portion 
			identifies the host within the network
			usually broken further into subnets
				> subnet ID
				> Host ID 
	subnet mastk tells where the IP is broken into these parts
	subnet mask HAS to go with IP address

- IP address classification
	classful
		--> dont use anymore
		--> fixed length subnet mask
		--> network parts were identified into 5 address classes
			in practice allowed three possible network sites 
				> Class A takes first octet for network, last 3 for hosts
				> class B takes first two octets for network , last 2 for hosts 
				> etc etc etc 
			255 numbers possible in one class

	**class A networks: **
		first octet is in the range 0 - 127
		7 bits in network id
		address starts with 0 (ranging from 00000000 - 01111111) so 128 possible class A netowrks
			--> actually only 126 because 127 and 10 are both reserved
				> 127(.0.0.1) for loopback (check to see if stack is working)
				> 10 for private IP addresses 
		so first bit can be looked at to see if it is a classful network  
		next 24 bits are host addresses so each network has 2^24 = 16,777,216 IP 
		default subnet mask : 255.0.0.0
			--> 255 means "turn on" all 8 bits in the first octet and none in the other octets 
				> remember that shit above about 255 nubmers in one class 

	**class B networks: ** 
		first two bits are "10"
			--> (second bit is 0)
		first octet ranges are from 128 - 191 (ranges from 1000000 - 10111111)
		default subnet mask : 255.255.0.0
		14 bits for network id (not 16)
		16 bits for host address in each network 
		private class B addresses are 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 and a subnet mask 255.240.0.0
 
	**class c networks: **
		first three bits are "110" 
		first octet ranges are 192-223 or 11000000-11011111
		default subnet mask : 255.255.255.0
		21 bits for network ID 
		8 bits for host address in each network
		pricate class c addresses are 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 and subnet 255.255.0.0

	classless : classless Inter-domain routing
		--> fixed length subnet mask
	VLSM : variable length subnet mask
