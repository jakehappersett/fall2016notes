Packet structure

- packet switching vs circuit switching 
	packet switching was originially set up to handle data
	circuit --> voice
	packet switching morphed to be able to handle voice and video 
	packet switching excells at "burst" data transfer (about 100x more efficeint than circuit switching)*****
- advanteages of packetization
	communication link costs are high relative to switching cost
		ex highways are more expeensive than automobiles
		efficieint utilization of communication links is more important than conserving ocmputation effort
- protocol
	provide information to recieveing station so changes can be made along the way
	rules to make exchange:
	1 define how the data is to be packaged or formatted
	2 what is the language (html or smtp etc etc etc)
	3 speed - controlling speed of the exchange 
	4 timing - when to exchange
- layering
	arranging funtionality in a hierarchical manner such that lower layers provide funtions and services that support the functions and services of higer layers 
	****allows for innovation and standards***
	advantages:
		seperation of functionality
			simplification of upgrades
		simplification in adding new technology
			ex: adding wireless network capability doesn not require change in we site addresses
- data is sent as packets
	packetization requires:
		1 specifiying user commands : user commands 
		2 segmentation and reassembly of packets : sequence numbers
		3 indentifying and locating packet destination : address (IP and MAC address)
		4 error control and correction (what) : error check 
		5 signaling ( how are the bits being represented electrically) : none
	much of this informatoin is includeded in the data (called a frame)
