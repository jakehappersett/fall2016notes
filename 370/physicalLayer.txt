*Physical Layer**

- four physical layer components
1 signaling method
2 circuit configuration 
3 transmission medium (wired, wireless)
4 devices typically associated with the layer (repeaters multiplexers, modem, NIC, etc)

- signals
	data needs ot be converted into signals to be transmitted
	used to represent bits
		
	physical layter interacts w/ nature
		signal transmitting properties of chosen media are important 
- copper wire 
	in networking, 8 strands of wire are organized as four pairs
		wires are twisted (greater number of twists, the higher the throughput) 
		--> difference between CAT5 and CAT6 is number of twists per inch
		--> range from cat1-8 8 being the highest throughput (40Gbps)
- optical fiber
	glass 
	works on large volumes of data over long distances
	weighs much less than copper
	~ 1Tb/s
	
	types:
		multiple mode : 
			uses LED as light source
			used on short links
	
		single mode: 
			uses laser light source 
			can transmit data over very long distances 
			higher speed than multimode 
- data vs signals
	data
		representation of facts in a formalized manner suitable for communication or processing by humans
		ex. thoughts in humnas or numbers in computer spreadhseets
	
	signal
		detectable transmitted energy that can be used to carry information 

- signals
	changes in energy that can be detected at the reciever
	good signals provide
		> easy detection by reciever
		> immunity from noise
		> efficient use of bandwidth
		> multiplexing

	impacts of improved signaling:
		> easy reception
			newer signaling schemes require less transmission power to send detectable signals and can ve smaller
		> noise resistance
			ex fm has better noise resistance than am 
		> efficient utilization of bandwidth
			data compression improved signaling
		> multiplexing 
			radio tv cell phones fire police wifi and other users can easily transmit signals over the same space 

	categories of signals
		> digital signal
			descrete:
			high - 1 
			low  - 0
		> analog signal
			continuous 
	
	manchester encoding
		> it's easy for a stream of 0s and 1s to get lost
		> sending and recieving device need to be syncronized 
		> done by establishing a time interval 
			--> sent like : 0|0|0|0  ----> recieved like: 0   | 0|0  | 0
			--> called clock slippage
		> manchester encoding embeds times into signal
			--> instead of 0 = -5V, 1 = +5V
			--> 1 = -5V to +5V, 0 = +5V to -5V
			--> watch them videos

	Analog signals
		> still use manchester encoding
		> sine waves: (amplitude, frequency, phase) 
			AM : amplitude modulation 
				height of wave
			FM : frequency modulation
				num of waves over time
			PM : phase modulation
				efficient takes more bandwidth
				requires 3d view of wave (quadrant shit)
			QAM : quadrature amplitude modulation
				combindes am and pm, uses modems
				used in tv, wifi	

				adds the standard (01) with: 
				q1 : 11
				q2 : 00
				q3 : 01 
				q4 : 10 
			OFDM : orthadical frequency design modification
				used in wifi
				comvindes FM and PM 

	Transmission impairments
		> attenuation : loss of signal 
		> distortion delay : signals travel at different speeds 
		> noise : crosstalk 
		> dispersion : signal disperses into sepperate wavelengths

- Multiplexing
	also known as muxing
	sending multiple signals simultaneously on the sma emedium
		>ex. radio station
	IMPORTANT milestone in data communication

	LAYER 1 ACTIVITY

	
- duplex 
	walkee talkee
- simplex 
	one way communication

- bandwidth 
	measure of available or comsumed data communcation resources expressed in bits
- bit rate
	number of bits that are conveyted per unit of time
- channel capacity 
	upperbound on the amoun of data tha can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel
