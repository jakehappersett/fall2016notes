- multiplexing v. channel access
	multiplexers are layer 1 devices
	channel access method or multiple access method occurs at layer 2 
		> used a nic card
			does manchester encoding
			implements a way to multiplex within a single local area network 
			mac address
- cables 

	crossover cable: wire connected to pin1 on one side will no longer be connected to pin one on the otherside. four wires will cross over in a crossover cable 1,2,3,6 are croseed to 3,6,1,2
		> used to connect like devices such as PC to PC

	straight through cable: pin 1:1 2:2 3:3 etc

	rollover cable: all 8 wires are rolled over to another pin at the other end of the cable.  1:8 2:7 3:6 etc etc.
		> this is a cisco specific cable 
		> used to service routers 

- pulse code modulation 
	
	quantization: converting analog signal into a number (binary)  
		> voice --> codec ; analog --> digital

- network topologies 
	
	point to point and mesh are most common
	
	bus connection : ethernet connection 

- IEEE 802.3 medium notatoin == ethernet 
	
	standard notaion is
		<data rate in Mbps><signaling method> maximum segment length in hudnreds of meters><T for twister pair><F for fiber> 
** look at 802.3 media options in powerpoint ** 

- MAC address : a unique identifier assigned to each NIC for communications at the physical layer
	
	a six byte address written in the NIC card in hexadecimal
		> first 3 bytes are the organizationally unique identifier and the next 3 bytes are NIC specific
	
	read by layer 2 switches
