** data link layer ** 
(for now talking specifically focused on ethernet)

- functions of the data link layer
	encapsulate packets into frames and MAC addressing(switches) [MAC host addressing (switching)]
	detec and discard errors that may occur in the physical layer [error detection]

- hop : identifies the number of switches or routers encoutntered, each switch or router constittes a hop!
	in packet switching a packet contains a hop count which increments with each hop. 
		> a packet iwth too large a hop count is discarded 

- switch vs. hub
	hub : a device capable of only broadcasting

	switch: device capable of unicasting, multi-casting, and broadcasting	
		> stops broadcasting when it is picked up and starts unicasting
		> almost used exclusively now instead of hubs
- PDU : protocol data unit

	layer 1: PDU is the bit
	layer 2: PDU is the frame
	layer 3: PDU is the packet
	layer 4: PDU is the segment
	layer 5 and above: PDU is DATA

- Ethernet
	low cost, high speed 
 	****can be 100 meters in radius and support about 250 devices***** (per segment) 

- LAN Ethernet protocol architecture
	consists of two sublayers
		1 medium access control MAC - physical
		2 logical link control LLC - logical

- logical link control
	allows support of multiplexing via service access points
	allows flow control through automatic repeat request (ARQ)

- connection vs connectionless service
	connectionless : like sending mail through the postal system.  
		> data is sent and we hope it arrives at its destination 
		> no feedack from the destination to indicate wheter it arrived or not
		> (tech equivalent is email)
	connection: like a phone conversation
		> connection is established by dialing an number
		> someone picking up the line establishes connection
		> connection is confirmed between the two parties
		> acknolwledgment is called an ACK
		> repeat is called a ARR (automatic repeat request)
- LLC sublayer
	max size is 1500 octets/bytes
	controls how things are logically put together
		> tells the NIC card where to buffer information it gets
- CSMA / CD 
	when networks are on a bus (single line)
		> computers listen to bus before sending data
	1 if medium is idle transmit
	2 if medium is busy listen until idle and then transmit
	3 if collision is detected sending hosts cease transmitting and send ajam signal
	4 after a collision wait a random amount of time before retransmitting 

 	advantages of csma/cd
		> simple to implement, therefore inexpensive and fast

 	disadvantages 
		> not scalable 
		> network may not be available when needed

- hub v bridge v switch
	hubs simply broadcast : doesn't ever read the MAC address
	bridge has two ports so communications can only be between two ethernet segments : only forwards frames with MAC addresses on the output segment
	switches have a one to one correspondence with each device and port on the switch
		> frame comes in 
		> switch sees which port it comes in from and sees frames source MAC address
		> uses source address not destination address  to build table
		
- switch
	builds and maintains a forwarding table which contains the MAC addresses of the frames on the switch

- forwarding table 
	source MAC address is read and added to the switches forwarding table if not there
		> flooding : switch has no entry for the frames destination MAC address; the switch then sends out the frame to every port on the switch (*except the port it recieved the frame on)--> destination address replys and switch builds table
		> forwarding : performed when a switches forwarding table has an entry for the frames destination MAC address, the frame is sent to the port with that MAC address host
		> filtering : switches forwarding table has an entry for both the source and the destinagtion MAC address (can happen when two computers are connected on a hub and the hub is connected to the switch); drops the frame 

- layer 2 switches

	three types:
	1 stores and forwards : buffers, checks for errors, sends it forward
i	2 cut through : only reads header to get MAc address, (doesn't check), then sends frame on its way
		> quicker
	3 adaptive switching : dynamically selects between type one and two depending on the conditions
