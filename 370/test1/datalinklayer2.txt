**Redundancy checks**

- logitudinal redundancy check (LRC)
	organized data into a table to create a parity for each column

- parity or vertical redundancy check
	append a single bit (0 or 1) at the end of data block so that the number of ones is even 

>>>> these two can be combined to allow for error connection 


- CRC-32
	only does error detection
	the probability of detecting a random error increases as the width of the checksum. 
	a 32-bit checksum can detect 99.9% of random errors
		> if it detects error, asks to correct error
