- SPanning tree protocol
	inteligently blocks ports so traffic doesn't loop on switch
		--> one switch becomes "root bridge"
			>> all traffic flows through this bridge
		--> each other switch chooses wat to get to root bridge
			>> closes off other ports (still up, just not listening)
		--> physical redundancy remains, logical redundancy is elimintted
	
- switching or bridge loop
	occurs when there is more than one layer 3 path
		--> loops indefinitely 

- shortest path bridge
	similar to spanning tree, but uses more intelligent algorithm to make decisions
	"open shortest path first" 
		--> picks topology that is most efficient
