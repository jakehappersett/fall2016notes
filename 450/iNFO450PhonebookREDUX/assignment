 Functional Requirements:

Your new and improved phonebook should provide the following functional capabilities:
-The user should be allowed to enter up to 100  phone numbers entries where each entry contains a
-Full Name
-Home phone
-Mobile Phone

Your program should require the user to enter a full path filename of an existing or new phonebook; if existing ,  the all entries in the file should be read into the application. 
-Your program should also allow the user add additional entries to the phonebook and, prior to exit, write them to the file.
-When writing to the file  your program should ensure the entries are not duplicated.
-Your program should allow the user to Display the phone book regardless of the number of entries,  presenting 5 at a time with a pause/continue step in between pages
-Your program should check for duplicate entries and not add them to the phone book
-Your program should keep track of the number of entries so to not overfill the phonebook
Extra Credit:
Your program should provide an option to search the phonebook by name and display all entries matching the search criteria.  Note: the user need only to provide a portion of the name and not the entire string.
Hint: look up the string function strstr()

 Program Requirements:
Design and implement a proper object oriented program in C++ to support all of the above  functional  requirements.  
You must use a array of pointers to store the phone book and new each phone book entry as it is entered or read from the file.
Define class member data, constructors and member functions  as required to fulfill on the requirements.
The program should use file streams to Read and Save the phonebook
Entries should be written to the file in a structured, pipe delimited format.
